Hello and thanks for stopping by! I am Yash Kothari, an undergraduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I am also an undergraduate student researcher, working on projects in the fields of computer vision, robotics, and machine-learning based physics. I have had the pleasure of being advised by Dr. James Hays, Dr. Spencer Bryngelson, Dr. Florian Schaefer, and Dr. Sehoon Ha over the course of these projects. Furthermore, I have had the good fortune to be mentored by Benjamin Wilson (PhD Student in Hays' Lab) and Joanne Taery Kim (PhD Student in Ha Lab).
